# this is just an idea

But for just create a test to have 2 things collide each other, one from left the other from right

So 1 box from left moving to right, then another box from right moving to left

See what defines a movement where phasing thru is impossible

I think its just not being able to jump more than or equal to its width, so max jump is width - 1

So test that first and if that works then forget about this
