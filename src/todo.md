1. [ ] tiled cannot do blob, so study tiled online see what can you do with it, for now restorting to wang mode. knowing how to use tiled is important since its what i use to make levels (place pre render bg instruction or place interaction, like enemies, boxes, cutscenes, etc)
2. [ ] create that hollow knight enemy, the ones that fly around idk find out what its called
3. [ ] dump that enemy into quad tree, each enemy, player, cam and bullets will look for em
4. [ ] enemy bounces off of walls and each other
5. [ ] if player touch enemy player gets hurt
6. [ ] if bullet touch enemy enemy gets hurt
7. [ ] when player shoot, there should be bullet shell, these ones just interact with tiles but is also in quad for cam to update and draw
8. [ ] so think about how to use the quad, one quad or multi quad? i guess 1 quad for 1 thing is good, 1 quad for bullet shell and 1 quad for enemy
