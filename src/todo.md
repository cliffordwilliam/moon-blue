1. [ ] create that hollow knight enemy, the ones that fly around idk find out what its called
2. [ ] dump that enemy into quad tree, each enemy, player, cam and bullets will look for em
3. [ ] enemy bounces off of walls and each other
4. [ ] if player touch enemy player gets hurt
5. [ ] if bullet touch enemy enemy gets hurt
6. [ ] when player shoot, there should be bullet shell, these ones just interact with tiles but is also in quad for cam to update and draw
7. [ ] so think about how to use the quad, one quad or multi quad? i guess 1 quad for 1 thing is good, 1 quad for bullet shell and 1 quad for enemy
